if your web camera is blinking on video calls: https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-camera/9WZDNCRFJBBG

In this app you can click on the settings gear on the top left, click video settings and there you have a "flicker reduction" option that you should select to 50Hz in Europe and Asia, but 60Hz in the Americas.
Then you have to change it to appropriate value every time you travel to a country with a different frequency in the power grid.

You'd think in 2023 a modern operating system, driver, video chat software _or something_ should detect camera flickering and set the filter appropriately, but no :)
