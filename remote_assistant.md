## Job Offer: Remote Assistant

Reef Technologies is a fully remote software house that works with clients from many different countries, including the US, the UK, and Canada. The demand for our work is extremely high, and we are constantly expanding our operations.

**Due to the increasing operational workload, we are now looking for a remote assistant to join the company and perform a variety of tasks to support our Chief Executive Officer**. Managing a software house entails many different responsibilities. Some of them are absolutely necessary, but too time-consuming for the CEO to deal with them himself. And that is where you come in. We need someone to maintain close contact with our CEO, Paweł, and take care of mainly personal but also professional tasks that he needs to be taken care of.

We are **100% remote**, and that applies to you, too. You’ll be free to work from wherever you want to, as long as it doesn’t interfere with your work duties.

**Some of your main obligations would be to:**
- Assist the CEO and his family in personal matters such as performing research, ordering products, organizing family holidays or making appointments.
- Assist the CEO through performing basic technical, logistic & administrative tasks.

The description is vague by design – we need someone to deal with both repetitive tasks and ad-hoc solutions. The work responsibilities are diverse, but mostly basic.

**We are looking for someone who satisfies the following requirements:**

- **Fluent English (B2 level) is indispensable** – we use English to communicate with pretty much all of our clients. Our staff members are international, and apart from one-on-one conversations with other Polish speakers, (mostly written) English is our everyday language. You will mostly use Polish when communicating with the CEO and his family, of course, but sometimes you may be required to contact someone in English. However, **we do not require Polish language skills**. All the communication may be in English.
- **A smart, respectful, and concise communicator** – we work remotely, so precise communication is of great importance.
- **A responsible and independent worker** – we respect each other’s time and keep our commitments, and we expect you to do the same. You should know how to self-regulate your work in a remote environment. We are looking for someone whose presence will bring order and not chaos. Everyone makes mistakes, but we expect you to focus and make sure not to repeat them.
- **A resourceful and active learner** – you’ll need to use many different tools, and Google will be one of the most important. You need to be an efficient researcher and enjoy getting to know new things. We appreciate people who are always looking for methods to improve the way they work, and even the way the whole company works.
- **Not afraid of basic digital tools** – you will definitely need to use Excel/Google Sheets, Google Docs, Slack, Trello, Hubstaff, and probably many other websites and applications. We don’t expect you to be a fluent user of all programs that we happen to use at the company, but we’re looking for someone who’s not afraid to learn new tools and simply Google things when not sure what to click.


**What do we bring to the table?**

- You can expect lots of **independence**. You don’t need to commute anywhere, and we don’t have a dress code. This job is 100% remote. We mostly work asynchronously. While some tasks may need to be done at a certain time or you may need to arrange a call with someone at a set hour, in general, you will not need to work “9 to 5”. 
- Your availability is up to you. We require availability of **no fewer than 80 hours calculated by a time tracker per month**, but there is no upper limit. You can work with us on a full-time basis. A frequently asked question about this point is whether this job can be combined with some other employment? Unfortunately experience shows that while it would be acceptable on the trial period, it's not really sustainable in the long term.
- We are offering **a stable, long-term collaboration** via a contract of mandate or B2B contract.
- You can **learn a lot**. You can be sure to gain a lot of experience by dealing with various private and business administrative tasks. 
- **Your voice counts**. The company is small, and everyone hates bureaucracy at an equal level. You will enjoy a close working relationship with the CEO, and you are more than allowed to bring up your concerns or come up with new ways to improve the way we do things.
